# Minecraft Computer
This is an 8-bit computer in Minecraft!

## Inspiration
This project is based on a video series by Ben Eater which shows how to build an 8-bit breadboard computer. All of the components of his computer can easily be represented by logic gates which are also possible to create in Minecraft using redstone. The goal of this project is to eventually make the computer Turing-complete.

The series by Ben Eater can be found here for those who are interested: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU
